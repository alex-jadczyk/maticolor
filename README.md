# Maticolor
Access this webpage here: https://alex-jadczyk.github.io/maticolor/

This is an example webpage I coded for the company of my dad who sells wood paints. As he is growing and selling to big companies in Poland, he may, in future, invest in international sales.
Right now he is using another website I made: https://paintingus.wordpress.com/

## What I like on this webpage:
- fully responsive and in pure CSS
- the code is quite readable because I used comments, semantic HTML and tried to use BEM methodology (although the last one not in all places; the code needs to be improved)

## What needs to be done to make it better:
- more BEM
- probably more div with classes instead of using combinators with raw tags
- contact maybe in PHP

## What I learnt:
- I was trying to be minimalistic with the code. Trying not to use a lot of div was a noble idea (avoiding 'div soup') but it does not work in the long run (this would work only if the code was not meant to be modified later)
- static websites are boring AND Sass is a nice thing (DRY)
- the code needs to be planned well and readable

### IMPORTANT: I do not own pictures on this page, I created the page just for educational purposes for now.
