# Maticolor
Access this webpage here: https://alex-jadczyk.github.io/maticolor/

## What I like on this webpage:
- fully responsive and in pure CSS
- the code is quite readable because I used comments, semantic HTML and tried to use BEM methodology

## What I learnt:
- I was trying to be minimalistic with the code.
- static websites are boring AND Sass is a nice thing (DRY)
- the code needs to be planned well and readable

### IMPORTANT: I do not own pictures on this page, I created the page just for educational purposes.
